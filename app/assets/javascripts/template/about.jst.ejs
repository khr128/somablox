  "...no time, no leisure ...not a moment to sit down and think - or if ever by some unlucky
  chance such a crevice of time should yawn in the solid substance of their distractions, there is always soma,
  delicious soma..." - Aldous Huxley, Brave New World

"...invented by Piet Hein ...[who] conceived of the Soma cube during a lecture on quantum physics by Werner Heisenberg.
...As Heisenberg talked on, Piet Hein swiftly convinced himself by doodling on a piece of paper that the seven pieces, 
  containing 27 small cubes, would form a 3x3x3 cube." - Michael Gardner, The Colossal Book of Mathematics
